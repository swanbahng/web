    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" title="wikipedia" target="_blank">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS,</a> is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. <strong>Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for <u>webpage behavior</u>.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
</p>

<p>
    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
</p>

<p>
    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
</p>

<p>
    Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
